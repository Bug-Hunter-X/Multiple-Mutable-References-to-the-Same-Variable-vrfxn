This example demonstrates a common error in Rust related to borrowing.  Rust's borrow checker enforces strict rules to prevent data races and memory unsafety. Attempting to create multiple mutable borrows of the same variable simultaneously results in a compile-time error. The solution involves restructuring the code to avoid these conflicting borrows, perhaps by using temporary variables or modifying the code's logic.
